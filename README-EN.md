# 30 Days Of Open Source

Welcome to the official repository of **30 Days Of Open Source**, a project led by the Oozons community to make open source more accessible — and a lot more fun — by gamifying it. 👾

This central repository contains the definitions of the base projects, templates, and shared resources for all contributors.

---


## 📌 Challenge Goal

- Create a structured environment where everyone can contribute, regardless of their level, to simple but useful projects.

- Encourage contributions (code, design, documentation, translation, visuals) in three main languages: Java, JavaScript, and Python.

- Motivate contributors with points, a leaderboard, and rewards for the top participants.
